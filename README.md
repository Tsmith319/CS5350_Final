# CS5350_Final Report
Within this file we will find the Perceptron learning models used for experimenting with the diagnosis of heart disease using three variants of Perceptron (Standard, Voted, and Average). When ran with the script file run_script.sh, the results will print out the training and testing accuracies for each variant of perceptron using a data set that has attributes that represent symptoms for those diagnosed with heart disease.
